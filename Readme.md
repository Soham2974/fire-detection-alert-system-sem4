# 🔥 Fire Detection and Alert System

## 📌 Overview
The **Fire Detection and Alert System** is designed to detect fire hazards at an early stage using **IR Flame Sensor, Smoke Sensor (MQ-2), Temperature Sensor (DHT11), and GSM Module (SIM800L)**. The system alerts users by sending **real-time SMS notifications** via GSM.

This project was developed as part of **Semester IV Mini Project (AY 2023-24)** at **Don Bosco Institute of Technology, Mumbai**.
